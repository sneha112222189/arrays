aArrays & ArrayList Repository

Welcome to my Arrays Repository ðŸŽ¯
This repo is dedicated to learning, practicing, and mastering concepts related to arrays, ArrayList, and related problems in Java. Alongside these, Iâ€™ll also be solving searching and sorting algorithm problems to strengthen the foundation of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

ðŸ“‚ What Youâ€™ll Find Here
Array Basics: Introduction and implementation of arrays.
ArrayList: Dynamic arrays, operations, and real-world usage.
Problems & Solutions: Step-by-step solutions to common array and ArrayList problems.
Searching Algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search, and their variations.
Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

ðŸš€ Goals of This Repo
Build a strong foundation in array-related problems.
Practice DSA concepts consistently.
Prepare for coding interviews by solving real-world problems.
Share a growing collection of solutions for anyone learning DS

This repository is part of my consistent coding journey and will be updated regularly as I learn and practice more problems.

Happy Coding! âœ¨
